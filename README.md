# Homogenization
M2R Project Numerical Simulation
In this repository two methods to demonstrate homogenization is presented.
Within Iterative Stencil Loop method, sub-folder includes images and code to generate them.


For Relaxation method, the Relaxation folder contains files directly used for generating graphs for the report and subfolders containing graphs (GPS) and history version of the codes(PointSource and used). Names of the ipynb file indicates the parameter used. PointSouce folder contains the code constructed for the problem in a point-source context, and used folder contains experimental codes for the project.
